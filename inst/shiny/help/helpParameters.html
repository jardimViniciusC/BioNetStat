<p>
    Before running CoGA, you must set the execution parameters available on
    the left sidebar. Below, we detail each differential 
    network analysis parameter.
</p>

<h5>Classes (conditions) being compared</h5>

<p>
    CoGA analyses compare only two phenotypes. If your dataset has more than two
    phenotypes, then you must select one pair of phenotypes from a list of
    all possible pairs.
</p>

<p>
    The selected pair will be used by all CoGA analyses.
</p>

<h5>Gene sets size range</h5>

<p>
    CoGA performs tests for each gene set of a collection of gene sets. To
    test only a subcollection of sets, you can filter the gene groups according
    to their sizes by setting the "Minimum gene set size" and 
    "Maximum gene set size" parameters. 
</p>

<p>
    The minimum gene set size allowed is 2. However, we recommend
    to test groups with at least 20 genes.
</p>

<p>
    Testing large gene sets can spend much time. In general, 
    it is feasible to set 1000 or some hundreds of genes as the maximum gene set 
    size. However this number may vary according to the user's machine specification.
</p>

<h5>Method for network inference</h5>

<p>
The network links are inferred according to a measure of association between the gene
expression levels. CoGA provides three classical association measures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Pearson: Pearson's correlation coefficient. It measures the linear 
        dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the
        Hmisc package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spearman: Spearman's correlation coefficient. It measures the monotonic 
        dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the
        Hmisc package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Kendall: Kendall's Tau coefficient. It measures the monotonic 
        dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the
        psych package.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The correlation coefficient or p-value obtained by one of the methods mentioned 
above are used to set an association degree for each link of the network. 
The following options are available to measure the association degrees: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Absolute correlation: the absolute value of the correlation coefficient</li>
    <li>1 - p-value: One minus the p-value of the test for dependence between
        two gene products. If the p-value is small, the expression levels are
        tightly associated.</li>
    <li>1 - q-value: One minus the adjusted p-value of the test for dependence 
        between two gene products. The p-value is adjusted by
         the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini and 
        Hochberg, 1995) method for multiple testing.
 </li>
</ul>

<h5>Network type</h5>

<p>You can choose between unweighted and weighted networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Unweighted: Graphs where all the edges are weighted by one.
        You must choose a threshold for the edges selection. Only
        the edges that connect genes with an association degree greater than
        the threshold will remain in the graph.
    </li>
    <li>
        Weighted: Weighted networks are full graphs where each edge has
        a weight. The weight of an edge is defined as the association degree 
        between the two gene products that are connected by it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Method for gene networks comparison</h5>

<p>
    CoGA compares the gene co-expression networks between two 
    phenotypes for each gene set.  
</p>

<p>Below, we describe the methods available for comparing <i>unweighted</i> networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Spectral distribution test: The spectrum of an undirected
        graph is the set of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. The spectrum distribution describes many topological properties of a graph, such as 
        the number of walks, diameter, and cliques. The spectral distribution 
        test is based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence between spectral 
        distributions (Takahashi <i>et al.</i>, 2012). It can be used to test if 
        two graphs were generated by the same model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spectral entropy test: It uses the absolute difference between spectral entropies (Takahashi <i>et al.</i>, 2012) to measure the difference in 
        the graph topological organization complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree distribution test: The degree of a node is the number of edges 
        that connect to it. The degree distribution test is based on the 
        Jensen-Shannon divergence between the degree distributions. CoGA uses the
        igraph package implementation of the node degree.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree centrality test: The degree centrality test
        is based on the Euclidian distance between the degree centralities 
        of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices.
    </li>
    <li>
        Betweenness centrality test: The betweenness centrality of a node is the number of shortest paths going through it (Freeman, 1979). 
        The betweenness centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between the
        betweenness centralities of
        the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices. CoGA uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Closeness centrality test: The closeness centrality of a node is the 
        inverse of the average length of the shortest paths between it and all 
        the other vertices in the graph (Freeman, 1979). The closeness 
        centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between the  
        closeness centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of 
        vertices. CoGA uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eigenvector centrality test: The eigenvector centrality of a node 
        <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> is the <i>i</i>th value of the first eigenvector 
        of the graph adjacency matrix (Bonacich, 1987). The eigenvector 
        centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between 
        eigenvector centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of 
        vertices. CoGA uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clustering coefficient test: 
        The local clustering coefficient of a node is the number of edges between the 
        vertices within its neighborhood divided by the number of edges that could 
        exist among them (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The clustering coefficient test
        is based on the Euclidian distance between the 
        local clustering coefficients of the two networks adjusted by the number 
        of vertices. CoGA uses the igraph package 
        implementation. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Shortest path length test:  The shortest path length test
        is based on the absolute difference between the averages of all the shortest path
        lengths for all pair of nodes <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and 
        <i>v<sub>j</sub></i> with <i>i</i> &#8800; <i>j</i>. CoGA uses the igraph package 
        implementation. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    CoGA includes generalizations of some of the statistics described above to 
    weighted undirected graphs. Let <i>G</i> be a weighted undirected graph. 
    We define the weighted adjacency matrix of <i>G</i> to be the 
    matrix <i>W = (w)<sub>ij</sub></i>, such that <i>w<sub>ij</sub></i> is the 
    weight of the edge that connects the vertices <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and 
    <i>v<sub>j</sub></i>.
    In this context, 0 &#8804; <i>w<sub>ij</sub></i> &#8804; 1 and <i>G</i> is a full graph.
</p>

<p>Below, we describe the methods available for comparing <i>weighted</i> networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Spectral distribution test: Replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the spectral distribution 
        test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spectral entropy test: Replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the spectral entropy 
        test for unweighted networks. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree distribution test: CoGA generalizes the degree of a node 
        to the sum of the weights of the edges that connect to it (Barrat, 2004). 
        The software uses the igraph implementation of the node strength. 
        It replaces the usual node degree by the weighted degree, and
        then computes the degree distribution test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree centrality test: Replaces the usual node degree by the weighted
        degree, and then computes the degree centrality test for 
        unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eigenvector centrality test: replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the eigenvector centrality 
        test for unweighted networks (Newton, 2004).
    </li>
    <li>
        Clustering coefficient test: replaces the local clustering coefficient 
        of a node by the sum of the weights of the edges between the vertices within its neighborhood divided by the number of edges that could exist among 
        them (Lopez-Fernandez <i>et al</i>, 2004). Then it performs the
        clustering coefficient test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For the "Spectral distribution test", the "Spectral entropy test", and
the "Degree distribution test" methods, you must select a criterion to
define the bandwidth for the probability density function estimation. The
available methods for computing the bandwidth are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Sturges: the bandwidth is defined as (max(x) - min(x))</sup>/<i>n<sub>bins</sub></i> (Sturges, 1926), where 
        x is the graph spectrum (for the tests based on the spectral density)
        or the node degrees (for the degree distribution test), and
        <i>n<sub>bins</sub></i>=&lceil;log<sub>2</sub>(<i>n<sub>V</sub></i>)
        + 1&rceil;, 
        with <i>n<sub>V</sub></i> denoting the number of genes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Silverman: the bandwidth is defined as 0.9min{sd(x), IQR(x)/1.34}
        <i>n<sub>V</sub></i><sup>-0.2</sup>
        (Silverman, 1986), unless the quartiles coincide,
        where <i>n<sub>V</sub></i> is the number of genes, sd(x) is the standard deviation of x, and IQR is the interquantile 
        range of x, with x denoting the graph spectrum (for the tests based on the spectral density)
        or  the node degrees (for the degree distribution test). If the 
        graph is empty, it is defined as 0.9<i>n<sub>V</sub></i><sup>-0.2</sup>.
    </li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>CoGA uses the R 'density' function from the base package for estimating the
probability density function.</p>

<h5>Permutation test settings</h5>

<p>
    To compute a p-value for the differential network analysis, CoGA performs 
    a permutation based test, which generates <i>N</i> random permutations of 
    the sample labels.
</p>

<p>
    The minimum possible p-value is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>N</i> + 1</sub>. 
    Therefore, the choice of <i>N</i> depends on the required significance level
    of the test. You can set the <i>N</i> parameter on the 
    "Enter the number of label permutations" option.
</p>

<p>
    To perform the same label permutations for all gene sets, you can set a seed
    to generate the random permutations on the "Enter a seed to generate random
    permutations" option.
</p>
